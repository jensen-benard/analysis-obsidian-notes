Let $n$ and $m$ be [[The Peano Axioms|natural numbers]]. 

## Weak inequality
We say that $n$ is greater than or equal to $m$, and write
- $n \ge m$ 
or
- $m \leq n$
if and only if we have $n = m + a$ for some natural number $a$.

## Strict inequality
We say that $n$ is strictly greater than $m$, and write
- $n \gt m$ 
or 
- $m \lt n$
if and only if $n \ge m$ and $n \neq m$.
