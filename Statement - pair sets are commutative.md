## Statement

For every object $a$ and $b$, we have,
$$\{a, b\} = \{b,a\}$$

## Proof

By [[Axiom - singleton sets and pair sets]], let $A$ and B be pair sets where
$$A = \{a, b\}$$
and
$$B = \{b, a\}$$

By [[Definition - equality of sets]], since both $A$ and $B$ contain exactly elements $a$ and $b$,
$$A = B$$
