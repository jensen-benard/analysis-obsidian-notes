When interpreting expressions built from natural numbers with addition and multiplication, we agree on the following convention:

- Multiplication is evaluated before addition.
- Parentheses may be used to override this convention and indicate a different intended grouping.

For example, the expression  
$$2 + 3 \times 4$$
is understood to mean 
$$2+(3×4)$$
and not  
$$(2+3)×4$$
