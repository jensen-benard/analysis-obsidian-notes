Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.

We say that A is a subset of B, denoted
$$A \subseteq B$$
if and only if every element A is also an element of B.

i.e. For every object $x$,
$$x \in A \implies x \in B$$
We say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, denoted 
$$A \subsetneq B$$
if $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$.
