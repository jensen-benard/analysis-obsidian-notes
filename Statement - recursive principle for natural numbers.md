## Statement

Suppose for each natural number, $n$, we have some function $f_n : N \rightarrow N$ from the natural numbers to the natural numbers.

Let $c$ be a natural number. 

Then we can assign a unique natural number $a_n$ to each natural number $n$, such that $a_0 = c$
and $a_{n\texttt{++}} = f_n(a_nn)$ for each natural number $n$.
