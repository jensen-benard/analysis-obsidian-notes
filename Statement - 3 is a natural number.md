## Statement

3 is a natural number.

## Proof

We know [[Axiom - zero is a natural number]].
By [[Axiom - injectivity of successor]], 0++ = 1 is a natural number.
By [[Axiom - injectivity of successor]] again, 1++ = 2 is a natural number.
Finally by [[Axiom - injectivity of successor]] again, 2++ = 3 is a natural number.
