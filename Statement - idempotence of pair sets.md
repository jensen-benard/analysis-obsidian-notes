## Statement

For every object $a$, 
$$ \{a, a\} = \{a\}$$
## Proof

By [[Axiom - singleton sets and pair sets]], let $A$ be a pair set, where
$$A = \{a, a\}$$
By [[Definition - equality of sets]], two sets are logically equivalent if they contain exactly the same elements, hence,
$$\{a, a\} = \{a\}$$
since both sets contain exactly the object $a$.
