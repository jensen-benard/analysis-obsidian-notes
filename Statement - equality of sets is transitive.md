## Statement

For sets $A$, $B$ and $C$, if
$$A = B$$
and
$$B = C$$
then
$$A = C$$

## Proof

Assume $A = B$ and $B = C$.

By [[Definition - equality of sets]], then 
for every element, being in $A$ is the same as being in $B$.

and

for every element, being in B is the same as being in C.

Putting these together, this mean for every element, being in $A$ is the same as being in $C$.
Hence, by [[Definition - equality of sets]],
$$A = C$$
