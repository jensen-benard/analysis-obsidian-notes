## Statement

For every object $a$, there exists exactly one set that has $a$ as its sole element.

## Proof

By [[Axiom - singleton sets and pair sets]], let $A$ and $B$ be singleton sets where
$$ A = \{a\}$$
and 
$$B = \{a\}$$
By [[Definition - equality of sets]],
$$A = B$$
since every element $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa.

Uniqueness is established because any two singleton sets containing $a$ must be equal.
