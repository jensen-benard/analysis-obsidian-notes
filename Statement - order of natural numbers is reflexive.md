## Statement

Let $a$ be a natural number. Then
$$a \geq a$$

## Proof

By the weak inequality [[Definition - order of natural numbers]], $a \geq a$ implies
$$a = a + n$$
for some natural number $n$.

We pick $n = 0$, giving
$$a = a + 0$$

By [[Statement - addition of identity on second term]],
$$a = a$$
Hence, $a \geq a$ is true and the statement is proven.
