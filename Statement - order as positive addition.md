## Statement

For natural numbers $a$ and $b$,

 $a \lt b$ if and only if $b = a + d$ 
 
 for some positive number $d$.
 
## Proof


### Proving the forward direction

Suppose $a \lt b$, as given from the statement.

By [[Definition - order of natural numbers]], 
$$a \neq b$$
Since [[Statement - addition with zero on second term for natural numbers]]. This means,
$$b = a + d$$
for some natural number $d$, where $d \neq 0$.

By [[Definition - positive natural numbers]], $d$ is a positive number.

### Proving the reverse direction

Suppose $b = a + d$, as given from the statement.

By [[Definition - positive natural numbers]], 
$$d \neq 0$$
Since [[Statement - addition with zero on second term for natural numbers]], 
$$b \neq a$$
since $d = 0$, hence $a + 0$, is required for $b = a$.

By [[Definition - order of natural numbers]], given $b \neq a$ and $b = a + d$, then
$$a \lt b$$

Since we have proven both directions, the statement is proven true.
