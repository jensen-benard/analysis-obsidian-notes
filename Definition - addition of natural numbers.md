We define the addition operation recursively from [[Statement - recursive principle for natural numbers]].

Let $m$ be a [[The Peano Axioms|natural number]]. 

To add $0$ to $m$, we define $0 + m \coloneqq m$. 

Now suppose inductively that we have defined how to add $n$ to $m$. Then we can add $n\texttt{++}$ to $m$ by defining $(n\texttt{++})+m \coloneqq (n+m)\texttt{++}$.
