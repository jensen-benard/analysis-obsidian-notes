## Statement
if $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers such that $a + b = 0$, then $a = 0$ and $b = 0$.

## Proof
We prove this by contradiction.

Say $a \neq 0$ or $b \neq 0$. Then $a$ is positive or $b$ is positive, respectively, from [[Definition - positive natural numbers]].
This means $a + b$ is also positive in either case since [[Statement - addition preserves positiveness of natural numbers]].

Therefore, $a + b$ cannot equal $0$, which contradicts the statement.
Hence, the statement is proven .
