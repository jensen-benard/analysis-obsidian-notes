# Obsidian notes for mathematical analysis

The repository stores a collection of notes written while going through mathematical analysis text books.

Currently going through analysis I by Terence Tao.

## Note Format
Each note is either:
- An axiom
- A statement (e.g a proposition, lemma, corollary)
- a definition
- a collection of statements (e.g a note containing properties of addition)

Almost every statement note file contains a proof for that statement, with links to statements, axioms, and definitions it depends on.

## Purpose
Going through the textbook and creating a collection of notes that link to each other to form a kind of dependency tree.
