Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be sets.

The intersection, $S_1 \cap S_2$ of two sets is defined by the set
$$S_1 \cap S_2 \coloneqq \{x \in S_1 : x \in S_2\}$$
In other words, $S_1 \cap S_2$ consists of all the elements which belong to both $S_1$ and $S_2$.
Thus for all objects $x$,
$$x \in S_1 \cap S_2 \iff x \in S_1\  \text{and}\ x \in S_2$$
