## Statement

For every object $a$ and $b$, there exists exactly one set that has exactly $a$ and exactly $b$ as its elements

## Proof

By [[Axiom - singleton sets and pair sets]], let $A$, $B$ be pair sets, where
$$A = \{a, b\}$$
and
$$B = \{a, b\}$$
By [[Definition - equality of sets]], 
$$A = B$$
since every element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa.
