## Statement

if $a$ and $b$ are objects, then
$$\{a, b\} = \{a\} \cup \{b\}$$

## Proof

By [[Axiom - singleton sets and pair sets]],
$$a,b \in \{a, b\}$$
and exactly contain the elements $a$, $b$.

Similarly, by [[Axiom - union of sets]],
$$a,b \in \{a\} \cup \{b\}$$
and exactly contain the elements $a$, $b$.

By [[Definition - equality of sets]], since both $\{a, b\}$ and $\{a\} \cup \{b\}$ contain exactly the same elements, then they are equal.
