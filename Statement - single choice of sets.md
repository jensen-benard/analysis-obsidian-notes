## Statement

Let $A$ be a non-empty set. Then there exists an object $x$ such that $x \in A$.

## Proof

We prove by contradiction:

Suppose there does not exist an object $x$ such that $x \in A$.
This means, for every object $x$, $x \notin A$.

By [[Axiom - the empty set]], this is true for $A = \emptyset$.

This contradicts the assumption that $A$ is an non-empty set. 

In other words, the contradicting statement is only true if $A$ is an empty set.
