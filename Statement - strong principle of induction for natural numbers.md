## Statement

Let $m_0$ be a natural number.
Let $P(m)$ be a property applicable to an arbitrary natural number $m$.

Suppose that for each $m \geq m_0$, we have the following implication:

if $P(m')$ is true for all natural numbers $m_0 \leq m' \lt m$, then $P(m)$ is also true. 
(In particular, this means that $P(m_0)$ is vacuously true).

Then we can conclude that $P(m)$ is true for all natural numbers $m \geq m_0$.


## Proof
