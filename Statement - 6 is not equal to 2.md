## Statement

6 is not equal to 2.

## Proof

Suppose $6 = 2$.

Then this is equivalent to, $5\texttt{++} = 1\texttt{++}$.

Hence, by [[Axiom - injectivity of successor]], $5 = 1$.

Hence, again, this is equivalent to, $4\texttt{++} = 0\texttt{++}$.

Finally, by [[Axiom - injectivity of successor]] again, $4 = 0$.

This contradicts [[Statement - 4 is not equal to 0]].

Therefore, $6 = 2$ is false. Hence $6 \neq 2$ is true.
